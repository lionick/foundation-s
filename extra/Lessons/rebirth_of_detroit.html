    <b>Intro:</b> In this unit, students will explore the rebirth movement of Detroit after the years of civil unrest in
    the city, specifically the development during the years of 1967 to 1974. Many people were in agreement that the city
    needed to be improved, but the actions that were taken to do so were often controversial. Students will also be able
    to see the connections between 1950s-1960s urban renewal efforts to the current-day developments in the city.
