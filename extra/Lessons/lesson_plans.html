<p>In the summer of 1967, Detroit experienced several days of civil unrest, marked by destruction and occupation by
  law enforcement and military units. Sparked by the raid of a party at a "blind pig" (an establishment without a
  license to serve alcohol), Detroiters in the 12th and Clairmount neighborhood took to the streets. For decades, they
  had seen police treat their neighbors and children unfairly, and many aimed to express their frustrations.</p>
